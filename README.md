# Chirp Demo

## Module 1: The Creative Storyteller (Showcasing TTS Voice Quality & Variety)

This demo focuses on the human-like quality and personality of the TTS voices.

### How it Works
The user is prompted: "Tell me the beginning of a story."
They press the "Talk" button and dictate a few sentences, e.g., "In a world made of candy, a gingerbread man set off on a quest to find the legendary chocolate river."

**On Screen (STT):** Chirp transcribes the story, automatically adding punctuation. The user can see and admire the accuracy.

**User Choice:** The screen then presents a "Voice Gallery" with profiles for different TTS voices (e.g., "Old Storyteller," "Energetic Youth," "Mysterious Narrator," "British Newsreader"). Each profile could have a fun avatar.

The user taps a voice.

**Audio Output (TTS):** The selected voice reads their dictated story back to them with impressive clarity and personality.


### Chirp Features Showcased
* Automatic Punctuation in STT.
* Superior naturalness and expressiveness of TTS voices.
* Wide variety of available voices and accents.


## Module 2: The Real-Time Captioner (Showcasing Speed & Accuracy)

This is a direct and powerful demonstration of Chirp's real-time performance.

### How it Works
The interface is very simple: a large, clean text area.
The user is instructed: "Press 'Start Captioning' and just start talking. Try speaking fast!"
As the user speaks, Chirp's streaming transcription populates the screen word-by-word, almost instantly.

**We could also make it possible to translate the speech to another language in realtime.
**
**Advanced Feature**: If two people are present, you can even showcase speaker diarization, where the transcript automatically identifies and labels "Speaker 1" and "Speaker 2".


### Chirp Features Showcased
* Low-latency streaming transcription.
* High accuracy even with rapid speech.
* Speaker Diarization (an advanced and very impressive feature).


## Module 3: The Singing Contest
