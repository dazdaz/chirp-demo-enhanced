## ðŸš€ Quick Start

**Choose your preferred method:**

### Option A: Docker Container (Isolated Environment)
```bash
docker build -t chirp-demo .
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id" \
  -v ~/chirp-demo-credentials.json:/app/credentials.json \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/app/credentials.json" \
  chirp-demo
```

### Option B: Run Locally on macOS

# Using uv (recommended - fast & modern)
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="~/chirp-demo-credentials.json"
uv run python main.py
```

## ðŸŽ® Features

### Module 1: Singing Contest
Karaoke competition - Sing along to popular songs and get scored.

- Select the song which you'd like to sing the words to.
- You'll see 4 sentences to sing, which will be highlighted so that you get the rhythm correct.
- Upon completion, you'll be added into a leaderboard.

**How it works**:
Sing the lyrics accurately to earn points based on accuracy, confidence, and timing.

**Features**:
- Low-latency streaming transcription
- Word-level confidence scoring
- Timing and rhythm analysis
- High score leaderboard
- Uses Chirp 2 for Speech-to-Text (STT) - configured in the streaming recognition config with model="chirp_2"
- Chirp 3 is not GA yet, but when available update line 242 in main.py and check regional support

### Module 2: Language Learning
Test your listening comprehension

- Listen carefully and transcribe phrases to learn new languages
- Select the language to hear the phrase in.
- Write doen the phrase which you heard.
- Then you'll see the meaning in English.

**Features**:
- Random phrase generation
- Accuracy scoring with Levenshtein distance
- Time-based bonus points
- Competitive leaderboard
- Uses Chirp 3 for Text-to-Speech (TTS) - uses "en-US-Chirp3-HD-Charon" voice for English synthesis

### Module 3: Analyze a Call
Call Analysis is a demonstration that shows how Chirp could be used for call transcription with speaker identification from multiple voices.

This is a static demonstration using hardcoded content, not actual Chirp speech-to-text with speaker diarization. It serves as a proof-of-concept showing what a call analysis interface could look like, but the transcript, speaker identification, and translations are all pre-prepared to simulate the experience.

**Features**:
- Transcribes spoken words into text
- Translates into a selection of 8 target languages
