# Chirp Demo

## Module 1: The Creative Storyteller (TTS Voice Quality & Variety)

This demo focuses on the human-like quality and personality of the TTS voices.

### How it Works
The user is prompted: "Tell me the beginning of a story."
They press the "Talk" button and dictate a few sentences, e.g., "In a world made of candy, a gingerbread man set off on a quest to find the legendary chocolate river."

**On Screen (STT):** Chirp transcribes the story, automatically adding punctuation. The user can see and admire the accuracy.

**User Choice:** The screen then presents a "Voice Gallery" with profiles for different TTS voices (e.g., "Old Storyteller," "Energetic Youth," "Mysterious Narrator," "British Newsreader"). Each profile could have a fun avatar.

The user taps a voice.

**Audio Output (TTS):** The selected voice reads their dictated story back to them with impressive clarity and personality.
